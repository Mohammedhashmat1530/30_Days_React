1)What is a JSX element?
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
In this example, <h1>Hello, world!</h1> is a JSX element that represents a heading level 1 element with the text "Hello, world!". When the code is compiled, it gets transformed into a JavaScript function call equivalent to React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!'), which creates a React element representing the same HTML structure.
