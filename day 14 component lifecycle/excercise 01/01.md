## what is component lifecycle
Component lifecycles in React refer to the series of phases a component goes through from creation to destruction. These phases include mounting (creation), updating, and unmounting. 

## What is the purpose of life cycles
These methods allow for tasks such as initialization, fetching data, performing side effects, and cleanup

## What are the three stages of a component life cycle
-mounting
-updating
-unmounting(destroying)

## What does mounting means?
Mounting in React refers to the initial phase of a component's lifecycle when it is being created and inserted into the DOM (Document Object Model). 

## what does updating mean?
Updating in React refers to the phase in a component's lifecycle when it undergoes changes due to updates in its props or state

## what does unmouting mean?
Unmounting in React refers to the phase in a component's lifecycle when it is being removed from the DOM (Document Object Model).



## Functional Component Lifecycle:

Mounting and Updating Phase:
useEffect(): This is the equivalent of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined. It accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.
With an empty dependency array ([]), it works like componentDidMount.
With dependencies, it behaves like componentDidUpdate, and it runs the cleanup function when the component unmounts.
