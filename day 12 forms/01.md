## What is the importance of form?
forms play a critical role in collecting user input and facilitating interaction in React applications

## How many input types do you know?
Text
password
Number
email
URL
Date
Time
Checkbox
Radio
File
Textarea
Hidden

## Mention at least four attributes of an input element
type
name
value
placeholder

## What is the importance of htmlFor?
The htmlFor attribute in React is used in conjunction with the <label> element to associate the label with a form input element.

## What is a controlled input?
A controlled input in React refers to a form input element whose value is controlled by React state. Instead of allowing the DOM to manage the input's state, React takes full control over it by keeping the input value in the component's state and updating it through the use of event handlers.

Here's how a controlled input typically works in React:

Initialization: The input element's value is set to a corresponding state variable.

Event Handling: React provides event handlers (such as onChange) to handle input changes. When the user interacts with the input (e.g., types into a text field), an event is triggered.

State Update: The event handler updates the component's state with the new value entered by the user.

Re-rendering: Since the input value is derived from the component's state, any change in state triggers a re-render of the component, updating the input element's value accordingly.

## What do you need to write a controlled input?
To create a controlled input in React, you need the following elements:

State Management: You'll need to manage the state of the input value. This typically involves using the useState hook (for functional components) or this.state (for class components) to create a state variable to hold the input value.

Event Handler: You'll need to define an event handler function to handle changes to the input value. This function will be triggered by the onChange event of the input element and will update the state variable with the new value entered by the user.

Value Prop: You'll need to set the value prop of the input element to the state variable holding the input value. This ensures that the input element's value is controlled by React state.

## What event type do you use to listen changes on an input field?
onchange

## What is the value of a checked checkbox?
<input type="checkbox" name="exampleCheckbox" value="yes">
In this example, if the checkbox is checked when the form is submitted, the value "yes" will be sent as part of the form data associated with the name "exampleCheckbox".

If no value attribute is specified, the default value of "on" is sent when the checkbox is checked. For example

## What is the purpose of writing e.preventDefault() inside the submit handler method?
When called within an event handler, such as a form submit handler, preventDefault() stops the default action associated with that event, such as submitting a form and refreshing the page.

## How do you bind data in React? The first input field example is data binding in React.

## what are event types do you use to validate an input?
onChange
onBlur
onSubmit
