## what is an event?
event refers to a user's interaction with the user interface, such as clicking a button, hovering over an element, typing into an input field, etc.

## What is the different between an HTML element event and React event?
HTML element events and React events are similar in concept but differ in implementation and handling

Some of the syntax difference between handling event in React and pure JavaScript:

    -  events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
    - With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## Write at least 4 keyboard events?
In React, you can handle keyboard events using event handlers like onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, and onFocus.
import React from 'react';

const KeyboardEventsComponent = () => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
    console.log('Key down:', event.key);
  };

  const handleKeyPress = (event) => {
    console.log('Key press:', event.key);
  };

  const handleKeyUp = (event) => {
    console.log('Key up:', event.key);
  };

  const handleFocus = () => {
    console.log('Input focused');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
        onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
        onKeyUp={handleKeyUp}
        onFocus={handleFocus}
        placeholder="Type something..."
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default KeyboardEventsComponent;

In this example:

    handleKeyDown: Logs a message when a key is pressed down.
    handleKeyPress: Logs a message when a key is pressed.
    handleKeyUp: Logs a message when a key is released.
    handleFocus: Logs a message when the input field receives focus.

## Write at least 8 mouse events?
import React from 'react';

const MouseEventsComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Clicked');
  };

  const handleDoubleClick = () => {
    console.log('Double-clicked');
  };

  const handleMouseDown = () => {
    console.log('Mouse button pressed down');
  };

  const handleMouseUp = () => {
    console.log('Mouse button released');
  };

  const handleMouseMove = () => {
    console.log('Mouse moved');
  };

  const handleMouseEnter = () => {
    console.log('Mouse entered');
  };

  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    console.log('Mouse left');
  };

  const handleMouseOver = () => {
    console.log('Mouse over');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick={handleClick}>Click me</div>
      <div onDoubleClick={handleDoubleClick}>Double click me</div>
      <div onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}>Press mouse button down</div>
      <div onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}>Release mouse button</div>
      <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>Move mouse pointer</div>
      <div onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}>Mouse entered</div>
      <div onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}>Mouse left</div>
      <div onMouseOver={handleMouseOver}>Mouse over me</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MouseEventsComponent;


## Write an event specific to input element?
An event specific to the input element in React is the onChange event. It is commonly used to handle changes in the input field, such as when the user types text or selects an option in a dropdown.
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const InputEventComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Type something..."
      />
      <p>Input value: {inputValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default InputEventComponent;


## Write an event specific to form element?
An event specific to the form element in React is the onSubmit event. It is commonly used to handle form submissions, such as when the user clicks a submit button.
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const FormEventComponent = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    username: '',
    email: ''
  });

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Process form data here, e.g., send it to the server
    console.log('Form submitted:', formData);
  };

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;
    setFormData({
      ...formData,
      [name]: value
    });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Username:
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          value={formData.username}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          type="email"
          name="email"
          value={formData.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default FormEventComponent;

Using event.preventDefault() in the handleSubmit function is a common practice in React when handling form submissions. It prevents the default behavior of the form, which is to perform a full page reload or navigation to a new URL when the form is submitted.

In single-page applications (SPAs) built with React, preventing the default behavior of the form submission is essential because you typically want to handle form submissions without causing a page reload. Instead, you may want to process the form data asynchronously (e.g., send it to a server using AJAX) and update the UI accordingly without reloading the entire page.


## What is the difference between onInput, onChange and onBlur?
    1) onInput:

The onInput event handler fires whenever the value of an input element changes, including every keystroke. It is triggered immediately as the user types or modifies the input field.
This event is useful for capturing real-time changes in the input field, such as updating suggestions as the user types in a search box.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
<input type="text" onInput={handleInput} />
onChange:

The onChange event handler fires when the value of an input, select, or textarea element changes and loses focus (i.e., when the user leaves the input field).
Unlike onInput, onChange is only triggered when the input field loses focus, which means it won't update the state on every keystroke but rather when the user finishes entering their input.
This event is commonly used to capture final input values or trigger actions when the user completes their input.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
<input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
onBlur:

The onBlur event handler fires when an input element loses focus, regardless of whether the value has changed.
It's typically used to handle actions or validations that need to occur when the user has finished interacting with the input field and moves to another element.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
<input type="text" onBlur={handleBlur} />


In summary:
onInput fires continuously as the user types, providing real-time updates.
onChange fires when the input field loses focus, capturing the final value after the user has finished inputting.
onBlur fires when the input field loses focus, regardless of whether the value has changed, often used for validation or other actions upon completion of input.
