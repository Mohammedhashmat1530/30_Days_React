## What is the importance of React Folder Structure and File Naming
The folder structure and file naming in a React project are important for readability, scalability, modularity, ease of navigation, consistency, and tooling automation. They help maintain a well-organized and easily navigable codebase, facilitate collaboration among developers, and improve overall code maintainability and scalability.

## How do you export file
Default Export: This allows you to export a single variable, function, or component as the default export of the file. When importing a default export, you can use any name you want.

// ExampleComponent.js
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  // Component code here
};

export default ExampleComponent;


Named Export: This allows you to export multiple variables, functions, or components from a file. You can then import these named exports in other files using curly braces {}.

// ExampleComponent.js
export const ExampleComponent = () => {
  // Component code here
};

export const someFunction = () => {
  // Function code here
};


## How do you import file
Combining Default and Named Imports:

import DefaultComponent, { NamedComponent } from './ExampleComponent';


Importing Files without Exporting Anything:
import './styles.css'; // Importing a CSS file for its side effects
