## What is a controlled input?
In a controlled input, whenever the user interacts with the input field (e.g., typing text into a text input), the value of the input is stored in the component's state, and any changes to the input value are reflected in the state. This allows React to have full control over the input's value and enables additional features like validation, formatting, or triggering side effects based on the input value.

## How do you get a content of a certain HTML element in React ?
In React, you can get the content of a certain HTML element by using a ref to reference the element and then accessing its textContent property
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  // Create a ref
  const elementRef = useRef(null);

  // Function to get content of the element
  const getContent = () => {
    // Access the element's textContent property
    const content = elementRef.current.textContent;
    console.log(content);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Attach the ref to the HTML element */}
      <p ref={elementRef}>This is the content of the element.</p>
      {/* Button to trigger getting content */}
      <button onClick={getContent}>Get Content</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;


## Why it is not a good idea to touch the DOM directly in React ?
n React, it's generally considered a best practice to avoid directly manipulating the DOM whenever possible. Instead, React provides a declarative and component-based approach to building UIs, where you describe how your UI should look at any given point in time,

## What is most frequently used in React ? Controlled or Uncontrolled input.
controlled input

## What do you need to write uncontrolled input?
Here's what you need to do to create an uncontrolled input in React:

    -Use Refs: You'll need to use the ref attribute to create a reference to the input element. This reference will allow you to access the DOM node directly.

    -  Accessing Input Value: Once you have a reference to the input element, you can access its value directly through DOM methods like .value.

    - Handling Events: You can still listen to events on the input element, such as onChange, onBlur, or onFocus, to perform any necessary actions or updates when the input value changes or when the input element gains/loses focus.
