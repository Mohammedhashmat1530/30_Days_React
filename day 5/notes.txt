Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is being used to pass data from one component to another and mostly from parent component to child component. We can say props is a data carrier or a means to transport data.

That means if you do not pass any attributes or properties when you instantiate the component, the props will be empty otherwise it will be populated with the data you passed as attributes and the proper name of these attributes are props.
