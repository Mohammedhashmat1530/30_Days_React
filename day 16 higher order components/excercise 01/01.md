## What is higher order function
A higher-order function is a function that can accept another function as an argument and/or return a function as its result. 

// Higher-order function example
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
  // This function accepts another function as an argument
  console.log("Executing higher-order function");
  callback(); // Execute the callback function passed as an argument
}

// Callback function
function callbackFunction() {
  console.log("Executing callback function");
}

// Passing callback function to the higher-order function
higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);


## what is higher order component
A Higher Order Component (HOC) in React is a pattern used to enhance the functionality of a component by wrapping it with another component
The concept of HOC is based on the idea of "composition" in React, where components are composed together to create more complex UI elements or behaviors.

import React from 'react';

// Higher Order Component
const withLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} is mounted`);
    }

    render() {
      // Wrapping the component and passing through any props
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};

// Original component
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.text}</div>;
};

// Wrapping MyComponent with the withLogger HOC
const MyComponentWithLogger = withLogger(MyComponent);

// Usage
const App = () => {
  return <MyComponentWithLogger text="Hello, world!" />;
};


## What is the difference between higher order function and higher order component?

Higher order functions manipulate functions by taking them as arguments or returning them. Higher order components enhance React components by wrapping them with additional functionality.

# A higher order component can allow us to enhance a component. (T or F)
True. A higher order component (HOC) can indeed allow us to enhance a component by wrapping it with additional functionality or behavior
