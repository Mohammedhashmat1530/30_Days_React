In one way or the other , the following packages are quite useful in the React application. Specially node-sass, moment and axios are important for some projects.

    -node-sass
    -axios
    -react-icons
    -moment
    -styled-components
    -reactstrap
    -lodash
    -uuid


## npm
You can use either npm or yarn to install packages. If you want to use yarn you have install it separately. I would recommend you to stick in one of the package. Don't use both package management tools in one application at the same time.

// syntax, we can use i or install
npm i package-name
// or
yarn add package-name
